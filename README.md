# This is my story of a dog called Snoupy

## Snoupy is a happy dog

### He likes playing a lot

#### And snoupy has a lot of friends

```Ocaml
Among his friends, there is a cat, a snake and a tiny little humain.

They walk around town all day long. Very often, they let themselves
fall asleep in the park. When they wake up, they are usually hungry and try
to sneak something up from the bakery.
```

    Slung trousers melt in a roseate box.
    A broken calendar oscillates like sunny tin.
    The craven linden growls swimmingly. Blowfish.
    A glittering roof slaps at CRAXY ephemera.
