This is my story of a dog called Snoupy
1, Snoupy is a happy dog
2, He likes playing a lot
3, And snoupy has a lot of friends

```Ocaml
Among his friends, there is a cat, a snake and a tiny little humain.

They walk around town all day long. Very often, they let themselves 
fall asleep in the park. When they wake up, they are usually hungry and try 
to sneak something up from the bakery.
